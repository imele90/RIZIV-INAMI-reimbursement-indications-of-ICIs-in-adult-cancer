A Prescriber-Oriented Tool for Reimbursement Indications of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Adult Solid Tumors in Belgium 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment landscape for solid tumors. In Belgium, eleven ICIs currently hold reimbursement approval for adult patients. However, reimbursement conditions are published by RIZIV/INAMI per pharmaceutical specialty, not by cancer type, making it challenging for prescribers to quickly identify the most appropriate option for a given diagnosis. A diagnosis-driven approach could streamline treatment selection and improve clinical decision-making.
We developped a prescriber-customized tool that consolidates reimbursement indications for ICIs by cancer type, disease stage, treatment intent, and line of therapy, thereby facilitating rapid and accurate treatment planning.
This pragmatic and time-saving tool addresses a critical gap in clinical practice by enabling prescribers to navigate reimbursement conditions efficiently. 
We therefore recommend its digital integration and monthly update on the Belgian Society of Medical Oncology (BSMO) website to ensure accessibility and sustainability.
